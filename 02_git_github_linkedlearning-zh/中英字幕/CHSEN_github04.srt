00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Pull request是用户请求对主站点进行更改的方式。
pull request is how users ask for changes to be made on the main site.

1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,940
现在 当你想对你的项目做一些小的改变时 你可以直接在Github上做这些
Now you can do them directly on Github when you want to make some minor changes to your project.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,630
我们来看看这是怎么做的
So let's take a look at how that's done.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,070
这是我们的项目
So here's our project,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:19,690
然后进入docs文件夹，看看index。html文件。
and I'm going to go into the docs folder and then take a look at my index.HTML file.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,900
我想做的是改变这个网页的标题，
And what I want to do is maybe change the title of this web page, 

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,800
因为它实际上是我从另一个项目中复制的东西，
because it's really something I copied from another project, 

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,300
它叫做布局。
and it's called Layout.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,730
也许在第一页 我要把这个名字改一下
So maybe on this 1st page, I'm going to change this name right here.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,200
要做到这一点，我可以点击这个编辑按钮，
So to do that, I can just hit this edit button right now, 

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,900
这将带我进入一个非常简单的编辑器。
and that will bring me into a very simple editor.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,920
注意 所有语法都是高亮显示的
Notice that it's all syntax highlighted.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,900
它有行号 这实际上是一个很酷的编辑器
It's got line numbers. It's actually a pretty cool editor.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,920
所以我要把这个布局标题改成学习Git和GitHub，这是这个项目的标题。
And so I'm going to change this layout title to Learning Git and GitHub, which is a title for this project.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,360
然后你可以点击预览预览它的变化
And then you can hit preview to preview that changes.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,740
这将在一个漂亮的小界面中显示您所修改的内容
This will show you what you have modified in a nice little interface.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,060
然后我们可以提交这些更改 就像我们在本地网站上做的那样
And then we can commit these changes just like we would on our local website.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,600
我在这里加一个注释
And I'll add here a note.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,400
你也可以添加一点扩展描述
And you can also add a little bit of an extended description.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,300
它是可选的 所以我将留空
It's optional, so I'm going to leave it blank.

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,550
这里可以决定我是从哪封邮件开始的
Here can decide which email I'm doing this from.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,400
这里你也可以选择，就像在本地版本中一样，
And here you can also choose, just like you can in the local version of this, 

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,700
要提交到主分支或创建一个新分支，
to commit to the main branch or create a new branch, 

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,000
这将生成所谓的拉取请求。
and this will generate what's called a pull request.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
现在我可以给这个分支命名，标题，更改，
Now here I can give this branch name, title, change, 

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,300
我不会提出改变，对吧?
and I'm going to hate propose changes, right?

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
现在它所做的是打开所谓的拉取请求。
So now what it's doing is opening up what's called the pull request.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,700
这就是，如果你是别人，或者即使是你自己，
This is how, if you were somebody else, or even if it's yourself, 

28
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,500
你可以打开一个请求，根据我们现有的两个不同的分支对这个网站进行修改，
you can open up a request to make changes to this website based on the two different branches that we have, 

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
原来的分支和我刚刚创建的分支。
the original branch and the one I just created.

30
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,970
你不需要做太多
And you don't really need to do much here.

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,560
你所能做的就是点击changetitle并创建这个pullrequest
All you can do is either hit change title and create this pull request.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,940
我们点击它
Let's go ahead and hit that.

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,900
现在创建一个请求。所以要创造一个改变似乎还有很长的路要走，
Now creates a request. So it just seems like a long way to go to just create a change, 

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,000
但它在这里做的是创建这个拉取请求，并给它一个数字，
but what it's doing here is creating this pull request, and it's given it a number, 

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,100
因为你可以有很多这样的东西，然后它就定义了一个关于项目的对话。
because you can have many of these, and then it sort of defined a conversation about the project.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,380
现在这个可以保持开放 你可以做笔记问别人
Now this can remain open, and you can sort of make notes to ask people.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,840
在这里输入一个注释 嘿 你觉得这个怎么样
Type in a note here, hey, what do you think of this?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,100
如果我跟其他人谈论这个头衔的改变，
If I was talking to other people of this title change, 

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,600
继续点击常见评论，让人们评论你在这里做的事情。
and just continue to hit common common comment and allow people to comment on what you're trying to do here.

40
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,800
然后其他人可以进来
And then other people can come in here 

41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,400
并就是否应该改变这一点发表意见。
and make their comments about whether or not this should be changed.

42
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,900
一旦你完成了这些，你想要合并pull请求，
Once you are done with this, though, you want to merge the pull request, 

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,800
我们需要做的就是点击合并拉取请求。
And so all we need to do here is click on this merge pull request.

44
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,570
现在我还需要做一件事 就是确认合并 对吧
And now I need to do one more thing, which is confirm the merge, right?

45
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,300
点击确认合并，
So I'm going to click on confirm the merge, 

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,800
即现在成功合并了请求并关闭了此pull请求。
and that is now successfully merged the request and closed this pull requests.

47
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,290
这是一个漫长的过程 但这就是你起床后的做法
So that's a long process, but it's how you do things on get up.

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,290
注意在右边有各种各样的项目管理的东西你可以做
Notice that there's all kinds of project management things on the right hand side that you can do.

49
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,490
除此之外 您还可以添加暹罗
In addition to this, you can add a Siamese.

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,500
现在，团队里只有一个人，
Right now, there's only one person in the team, 

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,600
但如果你有额外的人，
but if you had additional people, 

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,100
然后你可以指派一个人来审查提出的变更。
then you could assign somebody to review the change that is being proposed.

53
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,400
您还可以添加标签。这是典型的标签，
You can also add labels. So there's the typical label, 

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,300
所以你可以添加，也许是提议的拉取请求，
so you can add to, perhaps a proposed pull request, 

55
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,600
所以你可以在一个特定的话题上寻求帮助。
so you can ask for help on a specific topic.

56
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,270
这看起来不太亮 并把这些标签
This doesn't seem bright, and put any of these labels.

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,700
这些都很有用，
Those are kind of useful, 

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,400
因为你可以根据这些不同的标签来查找或排序。
because you can then look for or sort by these different labels.

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,700
您还可以创建里程碑。
You can also create milestones. 

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,800
里程碑是一种让您定义希望通过代码达到的目标的方法。
Milestones are a way of letting you define targets that you want to reach with your code.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
你做的另一个产品管理的事情就是得到Hub
So another product management thing that you do and get Hub.

62
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,420
然后你也可以将拉取请求与问题对齐
And then also you can align the pull request with an issue.

63
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,070
我之前确实给你们看过问题
So I did show you issues before.

64
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,250
你可以创建一个问题 说 嘿 我们需要修改这个项目的标题
You can create an issue and say, hey, we need to fix the title for this project.
