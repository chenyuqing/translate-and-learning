Github提供了很多工具来帮助你管理项目。
Github provides a lot of tools to help you manage projects.

1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,220
让我们来看看它们是如何工作的
So let's take a look at how they work.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,790
这里有一些你可以用来组织事情的工具
Here's some of the tools available to you to organize things.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,800
现在，第一项是贡献者。
Now, the 1st is contributors. 

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,300
你可以邀请其他人和你一起完成你的项目。
You can invite others to work alongside you on your project.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,770
这就是Github的特别之处。
That's really what makes Github special.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,700
你也可以制造问题，
You can also create issues, 

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:24,600
它允许您创建关于您的项目的笔记，可以由其他人共享和评论。
which allow you to create notes about your projects that can be shared and commented by others.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,940
它们通常是用来解决你需要解决的问题
They're usually for things that you need to fix.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,040
有几种方法可以组织问题
There's a couple of ways that you can organize issues.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,260
一种是用标签来帮助识别问题的目的
One is with labels that help identify the purpose of the issue.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,600
您可以添加这些标签中的一个或多个
You can add one or more of these labels.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,240
里程碑用于分组问题和需要实现的目标
The milestones are for grouping issues and to goals that need to be achieved.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
最后，项目是查看工作进度的一种方式
Finally, projects are a way to take a look at the progress of your work 

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,200
看看你完成目标的情况如何。
and see how well you are accomplishing your goals.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,660
让我们来看看这些
Let's take a look at these.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,100
现在我又回到了项目中，
Here I am back on the project, 

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
我想做的第一件事就是邀请一位撰稿人。
and the 1st thing I want to do it is invite a contributor.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,500
这是一个私人项目，
This is a private project, 

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,900
我要进入设置，向下滚动，管理访问权限。
so I'm going to go into settings and scroll down to manage access.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,070
在这里 你可以让应用程序重新输入你的密码
Here, you may get apps to rettype your password.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,470
现在你可以看到我还没有邀请任何人
Now you can see here that I haven't invited anyone quite yet.

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,000
点击邀请合作者，
I'm going to hit invite a collaborator, 

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,500
我想邀请我的朋友特里·达克尔
and I want to invite my friend Terry Dactle.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
你可以试着在这里输入名字，
So you can try typeping in the name right here, 

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,500
你可以在这里看到他。
and you can see him right here.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,100
你可以试着输入这个人的用户名，
You can try typing the person s user name, 

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,200
如果你知道，或者他们的电子邮件地址。
if you know it, or their email address.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,780
我将继续点击这个人并将Terry添加到这个存储库中
I'm going to go ahead and click on this person and add Terry to this repository.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
你会发现它的待定邀请减少了，
You'll see that it's less pending invite, 

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,900
这意味着特里应该收到一封邀请他参加这个项目的邮件。
and that means that Terry should have gotten an email with an invitation to this project.

31
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,990
现在 如果特里没有邀请函 它实际上只是一个项目的链接
Now, if Terry doesn't have that invitation, it's really just a link to the project.

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,000
所以你也可以进入团队，把项目的链接粘贴给他们，
So you can just also get into teams and paste the link to the project to them, 

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
他们就能钻进去。
they'll be able to get into them.

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,440
让我们从特里的角度来看这个问题
Let's take a look at this from terry's perspective.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,900
Terry收到了一封这样的邮件，所以现在如果我从邮件中进入url，
Terry has received an email like this, so now if I go to the url from the email, 

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,500
我可以点击“接受邀请”，然后我就可以看到这个泰瑞了。
I can click on accept invitation, and I'll be able to see this as Terry.

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,640
现在 让我们继续讨论问题 我要创建一个新问题
Now, let's go ahead and go into issues, and I'm going to create a new issue.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,620
假设我是Terry 我浏览了一下网站 发现了这个问题
Let's say that as Terry, I have taken a look at the website, and I noticed the problem.

39
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,090
所以我听不到所有页面标题的变化
So I couldn't hear change titles on all pages.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,100
哈利看了网站之后，
Since Harry reviewed the website, 

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,500
他注意到标题只在index.HTML页面上改变了。
and he noticed that the title was only changed on the index.HTML page.

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,540
从这里开始 我可以把这个问题分配给组里的一个人
From here, I can assign this issue to a person in the group.

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,550
我可以点击这里 把它分配给RabydeLobos
So I can click right here and assign this to Raby de Lobos.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,500
我也可以把它分配给我自己，
I can also assign it to myself, 

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,000
你可以把这个分配给不止一个人，
so you can assign this to more than one person, 

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,700
然后我可以添加一些标签。
and then I can add a few labels.

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,870
这在技术上可能是个bug 你可以分配多个东西
So this is technically maybe a bug, and you can assign more than one thing.

48
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,910
也许我应该加上这个invalid 因为这看起来不太对
Maybe I'll add this invalid, because this doesn't seem quite right.

49
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,400
这些标签允许你通过标签搜索不同的项目，
And these labels allow you to search different projects by the labels, 

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,300
通过标签很容易就能看出问题所在。
and it just makes it easy to see what the problems are by looking at the labels.

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,400
我要提交这个新问题，
I am going to submit this new issue, 

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,300
当我们在项目中添加新东西时，你可以看到我们所做的事情的历史。
and you can see a history of what we're doing as we add new things into the project.

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,280
让我们在另一个浏览器上看看这个
So let's take a look at this back on my other browser.

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,900
我们现在进入问题栏，
We'll go into the issues tab now, 

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,900
我们会看到我们从特里那里得到了一个问题。
and we'll see that we got an issue from Terry.

56
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,680
让我们来看看这个问题 我在这里加一个评论
So let's take a look at that issue, and I'll add a comment here.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
好的，我要在这里评论一下，
All right, so I'm gonna comment in here, 

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,500
我可以修改它，创造一个里程碑。
and I can modify this and create a milestone.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,200
所以我要添加一个里程碑，
So I'm going to add a milestone, 

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
你可以在这里输入一些东西。
and you can just type in something in here.

61
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,540
我把这称为最后的回顾
I'll call this one final review here.

62
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,300
里程碑是对不同问题进行分组的方式，
And the milestones are ways of grouping a number of different issues, 

63
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,400
所以如果你有很多问题，
so if you have a lot of issues, 

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,700
在最后的复习中，你们需要注意其中的一组，
and theres a group of them that you need to take care of for this final review, 

65
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,700
然后你可以给他们分配一个里程碑，对吧?
then you can assign them on milestone, right?

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,120
我们再试一次
So let's go ahead and try that again.

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:23,080
我应该在这里按回车键 这为最后的回顾增加了一个里程碑
I should have hit enter here, and that adds now a milestone for this final review.

68
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,690
看 这给我的工作增添了新的历史
And look, it gives me an additional history to what I'm doing.

69
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,430
在这里 你可以看到有两个参与者对这个问题发表了评论
Right here. You can see that there's two participants that have made comments to this issue.

70
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,700
这很好。现在，我注意到网站上有很多活动，
So that's great. Now, I'm noticing that there's quite a bit of activity going on on the website, 

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,600
真的不是很多。
really not a ton.

72
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,350
但也许现在是在这里创建一个项目的好时机
But maybe this is a good time to create a project here.

73
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,030
我要进入项目部分 点击创建项目
So I'm going to go into the project section and hit create a project.

74
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,330
我给它起个名字 这将是第一个版本的项目
I'll give this a name. This will be the project for the 1st release.

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,250
我喜欢在这里选择一个模板
I like to pick a template here.

76
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,310
Github为您提供了许多预构建的项目模板
Github gives you a lot of pre built project templates.

77
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:05,730
我真的很喜欢这个自动化看板。
I really like this automated Kanban. 

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,400
看板是敏捷方法的一部分，
Kanban boards are part of the agile methodology, 

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
它们是一种看待待办事项的二维方式。
and they're sort of a two-dimensional way of looking at to-dos. 

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:21,930
有人选择这个，然后点击创建项目?
Someone to choose this, and I'll hit create project, right?

81
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,900
你可以看到，当我创建一个项目时，
So you can see that when I created a project, 

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,900
它让我知道我可以在这里添加纸牌。
it's letting me know that I can add cards here.

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,340
我可以添加的其中一辆车是基于我之前创建的问题
And one of the cars that I can add is based on the issue that I created earlier.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,400
这里也有很多说明 你可以读一下
There's also a lot of instructions here, and you can read those.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,700
我要把它们处理掉，
I'm just gonna get rid of them, 

86
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:52,200
我要添加这个问题或者这张卡通过把它拖到这里的这个部分。
and I'm going to add this issue or this card by dragging it into this section right here.

87
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,700
我可以了结这件事。
I can close this out. 

88
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
您可以看到，您可以添加额外的列。
You can see that you can add additional columns.

89
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,020
默认情况下，我喜欢这三组列
I like these three sets of columns by default

90
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,900
你可以选择一个问题或一张卡，在你需要做的事情的状态上，
you can choose an issue or a card to be on either the state of something that you need to do, 

91
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,900
正在进行的事情，或者已经完成的事情。
something that's in progress, or something that's done.

92
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,550
既然我说过我会马上处理这件事 我就把它移到进行中
Since I said I was gonna take care of this right away, I'm gonna move this to in progress.

93
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,990
让我们回过头来看这个问题
Let's go back into the issue and take a look at that.

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
你可以看到所有这些更新
And you can see that all those updates 

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,300
我通过创建一个项目和移动东西所做的事情也改变了这个问题。
that I have done by creating a project and moving things around has modified what's happening with this issue as well.

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
这很方便。
And that's pretty handy.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
现在，你可以对问题做更多的事情，
 Now, there's a lot more that you can do with issues, 

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,500
但你可以看到，通过给问题项目加上标签，把事情组织成里程碑之类的东西，
but you can see that by adding labels to issues projects and organizing things into things like milestones, 

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,200
这真的让创建项目比自己记住所有东西要好得多。
really makes creating projects way better than trying to remember everything by yourself.
